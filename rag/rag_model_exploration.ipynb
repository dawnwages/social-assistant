    "Since VS Code team uses a GitHub repo to manage the release notes, I used the GitHub API to fetch the release notes. Each release notes \"document\" can be long, so I knew I had to chunk the data, and chunk them in a way that preserves text segments with related context. Since the VS Code team manages the release notes in markdown format, I used a markdown parser ([LangChain's `markdown_header_metadata_splitter`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/markdown_header_metadata_splitter/)) to chunk each release notes so that release features can fit into the embeddings models that have much smaller token limits.\n",

After the first request, the control expands to take up more space. We have also adjusted the rendering to be more consistent with other chat experiences, such as the Chat view or Quick Chat.  \\n![Inline Chat As Content Widget floating over the editor text](./images/1_88/inline-chat-content.png)\\n_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_  \\nWe\\'ve repositioned the rerun and feedback controls, and made the toggle control for viewing diffs more prominent alongside the Accept and Discard buttons.  \\n![Screenshot of the Copilot Inline Chat, showing the repositioned controls.](./images/1_88/inline-chat-convo.png)\\n_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_  \\n#### Notebook kernel state as context  \\nWhen you are in a notebook, the kernel state (for example, variables and available packages) is now automatically included as context in Inline Chat. This lets Copilot use the current state of the notebook to provide more relevant completions.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_88/notebook-kernel-context.mp4\" title=\"Notebook emebeds kernel state in context\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>  \\n_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_  \\n#### Commit message generation improvements  \\nTo improve the quality of the generated commit messages, we are now also including the commit messages of the 10 most recent commits in the repository, and the commit messages of the 10 most recent commits of the current user as extra context.  \\n#### Workspace creation improvements  \\nThe `@workspace /new` command now offers sample projects, curated from GitHub repositories, as suggestions when a suitable match is detected for the chat prompt.  \\n![Chat view with @workspace /new that provides a link to a sample project](images/1_88/new-workspace-project-templates.png)  \\nThe `@workspace /new` command has also been enhanced to more effectively manage context and history. This enables you to refine suggested workspaces structure and file contents by asking follow-up queries. For example, \"use TypeScript instead of JavaScript\" or \"also add bootstrap\".  \\n#### @terminal /explain slash command  \\nA new `@terminal /explain` slash command is available, which is optimized for explaining commands or errors. Without `/explain`, `@terminal` is optimized to suggest a fix. This slash command is used in the **Explain using Copilot** quick fix or the **Explain selection** actions.  \\n![Using the explain using copilot quick fix will ask copilot \"@terminal /explain #terminalLastCommand\"](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-explain.png)  \\n#### Preview: Terminal Inline Chat  \\nA preview of the terminal Inline Chat is available in this release, which gives convenient access to Copilot\\'s capabilities directly in the terminal.  \\nYou can enable terminal Inline Chat with the <code codesetting=\"terminal.integrated.experimentalInlineChat:true\">terminal.integrated.experimentalInlineChat</code> setting. To invoke the inline chat in a terminal, use the `kb(inlinechat.start)` keybinding.  \\n![Opening terminal inline chat will open and focus an input box similar to inline chat in the editor](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-inline.png)  \\nThe terminal Inline Chat uses the `@terminal` chat participant, which has context about the integrated terminal\\'s shell and its contents.  \\n![You can ask complex questions like \"list the top 5 largest files in the src directory\"](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-inline-query.png)  \\nOnce a command is suggested, use `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.runCommand)` to run the command in the terminal or `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.insertCommand)` to insert the command into the terminal. The command can also be edited directly in Copilot\\'s response before running it (currently `kbstyle(Ctrl+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on Windows & Linux, `kbstyle(Cmd+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on macOS).  \\n![Complex queries are OS and shell-specific](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-inline-answer.png)  \\n#### Clarity on authentication flow  \\nClarity around authentication is very important. We want to be clear about how we authenticate and what we ask for. If you open a private repository in VS Code, and we don\\'t have the right authentication for this scenario, we present an authentication dialog. The dialog has a description of why authentication is needed, and a **Learn more** button to find out more about these requirements.  \\n![Screenshot of a modal window that\\'s asking to authenticate with GitHub and that contains a Learn more button](images/1_88/learnmoreauth.png)  \\nThe **Learn more** button takes you to our [documentation on authentication requirements](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/blob/a032cf75104a99ca745118ca51ea77219441a898/docs/copilot-repo-scope.md).  \\n#### Variable references  \\nThe **Used references** section in a chat response gives information about the context that is used. Previously, this section only showed context that was pulled in implicitly. Now, it also shows variables that you mentioned explicitly in the chat prompt, such as `#file` or `#editor`. If a variable is missing from the Used references, it might indicate that it was ignored because it\\'s too large for the context window of the language model.  \\n![Screenshot of a chat response, showing the \\'#file\\' variable in the Used references section](images/1_88/chat-variable-reference.png)  \\n#### Secondary chat submit actions  \\nIn the Chat view, the chat submit button now has a dropdown for easy access to more actions.  \\n* **Send to @workspace** submits your query to the `@workspace` chat participant, which is useful for questions about the contents of your workspace\\n* **Send to New Chat** starts a new empty chat, and then submits the query  \\n![Screenshot of the chat submit dropdown options](images/1_88/chat-submit-dropdown.png)  \\n#### Scope selection when using `Copilot: Explain This`  \\nWhen you use `/explain` without a selection in your active editor, and there are multiple scopes of interest, we\\'ve added support for prompting to clarify which symbol or block scope to explain.  \\n![Screenshot of the scope selection quick pick when the scope for /explain is unclear](images/1_88/copilot-scope-selection.png)  \\nThis behavior is currently opt-in, behind the <code codesetting=\"github.copilot.chat.scopeSelection\">github.copilot.chat.scopeSelection</code> setting.',\n",

You can now attach more types of context to a chat message, such as workspace symbols. Previously, you used the \\'#\\' symbol to reference a file, or the current selection. Now, you can attach context  to a chat message by selecting the 📎 icon in the Chat view input field, or by typing `kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)`.  \\n> **Tip**: Use the right arrow key to quickly attach context in the background while you keep the context picker open.

To try out this functionality, install the latest pre-release of Copilot Chat.  \\nIn the Chat view, you can ask questions like `@github What is the latest LTS of Node.js? #web` to take advantage of web search. Any search results referenced by Copilot are displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.  \\n![Web search results in Copilot Chat](images/1_90/copilot-enterprise-bing-search.png)  \\nYou can also ask questions about your enterprise\\'s knowledge bases, which are collections of Markdown repositories containing documentation, directly from VS Code. Simply type `@github #kb` to pick from the knowledge bases available to you. Similarly, any knowledge base snippets referenced by Copilot are displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.  \\nThis enables Copilot Enterprise users to combine search results and internal documentation with editor context by using existing chat variables, such as `#file` and `#selection`. Please try it out and share your feedback with us at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release!  \\n#### IntelliSense in chat code blocks  \\nWe now support basic IntelliSense within Copilot-generated code blocks. This lets you use many of the same IntelliSense tools that you might already use in the editor and can help you better understand the generated code.  \\n![Hover IntelliSense in Copilot chat code block](images/1_90/copilot-hover-intellisense.png)  \\nThe supported IntelliSense features include:  \\n- Go to definition by using `kbstyle(ctrl)` `kbstyle(click)` / `kbstyle(cmd)` `kbstyle(click)` or `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)`\\n- Hovers\\n- Go to implementation\\n- Go to type definition  \\nIntelliSense can even be used with `@workspace` to learn about any workspace symbols that are used in Copilot responses.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_90/copilot-workspace-intellisense.mp4\" title=\"IntelliSense on a @workspace code block\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>  \\nIntelliSense for TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code blocks is available out of the box. For additional language support, try installing an extension for that language, although not every language extension already has support for code block IntelliSense. Please file feature requests for any languages that aren\\'t yet supporting this.  \\n#### Improved links in chat responses  \\nWe improved chat responses by adding links for file names and symbols. By selecting these links, you can navigate to the corresponding file or symbol in the editor.  \\n![Clickable links for symbols used with /explain](images/1_90/copilot-link-explain.png)  \\n![Clickable file and symbol links for an @workspace question](images/1_90/copilot-link-workspace.png)  \\n#### Roam active chat between inline chat and Chat view  \\nYou can now move a chat request that is completed or still active from inline chat to the Chat view. You might use this feature to clean up inline chat and move conversations to a more persistent place. To move a request, select the chat icon next to the chat input box.  \\n![Move a chat conversation from inline chat to the Chat view](images/1_90/move-chat-conversation-to-chat-view.png)  \\n#### Automatic rename suggestions  \\nIf you use the [Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension, the Copilot-powered rename suggestions are now triggered automatically when you rename a symbol. You can turn this feature off by using the setting <code codesetting=\"github.copilot.renameSuggestions.triggerAutomatically\">github.copilot.renameSuggestions.triggerAutomatically</code>.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_90/rename-suggestions.mp4\" title=\"Automatically-triggered rename suggestions\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>',\n",

A GitHub App is backed by a service and works across all GitHub Copilot surfaces, such as github.com, Visual Studio, or VS Code. GitHub Apps do not have full access to the VS Code API. To extend GitHub Copilot through a GitHub App, you should join the [Copilot Partner Program](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-partner-program). You can learn more by watching the [Extending GitHub Copilot](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/0121ee70-fd82-419f-a7ad-75bbb70cfd41) talk we delivered at the Microsoft Build conference.',\n",

Adding variables gives you more precise control over the context for your chat request, so that you get more relevant responses from Copilot.  \\nEither type `#`, followed by the variable name, or use the 📎 control (`kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)`) in Inline Chat to add a context variable.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_94/notebook-kernel-variable.mp4\" title=\"Attach a context variable by using `#` in a notebook chat request\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>',\n",

       " {'content': 'Learn what is new in the Visual Studio Code March 2024 Release (1.88)  \\n### GitHub Copilot  \\n#### Inline Chat improvements  \\nInline Chat now starts as a floating control, making it more lightweight. After the first request, the control expands to take up more space. We have also adjusted the rendering to be more consistent with other chat experiences, such as the Chat view or Quick Chat.  \\n![Inline Chat As Content Widget floating over the editor text](./images/1_88/inline-chat-content.png)\\n_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_  \\nWe\\'ve repositioned the rerun and feedback controls, and made the toggle control for viewing diffs more prominent alongside the Accept and Discard buttons.  \\n![Screenshot of the Copilot Inline Chat, showing the repositioned controls.](./images/1_88/inline-chat-convo.png)\\n_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_  \\n#### Notebook kernel state as context  \\nWhen you are in a notebook, the kernel state (for example, variables and available packages) is now automatically included as context in Inline Chat. This lets Copilot use the current state of the notebook to provide more relevant completions.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_88/notebook-kernel-context.mp4\" title=\"Notebook emebeds kernel state in context\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>  \\n_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_  \\n#### Commit message generation improvements  \\nTo improve the quality of the generated commit messages, we are now also including the commit messages of the 10 most recent commits in the repository, and the commit messages of the 10 most recent commits of the current user as extra context.  \\n#### Workspace creation improvements  \\nThe `@workspace /new` command now offers sample projects, curated from GitHub repositories, as suggestions when a suitable match is detected for the chat prompt.  \\n![Chat view with @workspace /new that provides a link to a sample project](images/1_88/new-workspace-project-templates.png)  \\nThe `@workspace /new` command has also been enhanced to more effectively manage context and history. This enables you to refine suggested workspaces structure and file contents by asking follow-up queries. For example, \"use TypeScript instead of JavaScript\" or \"also add bootstrap\".  \\n#### @terminal /explain slash command  \\nA new `@terminal /explain` slash command is available, which is optimized for explaining commands or errors. Without `/explain`, `@terminal` is optimized to suggest a fix. This slash command is used in the **Explain using Copilot** quick fix or the **Explain selection** actions.  \\n![Using the explain using copilot quick fix will ask copilot \"@terminal /explain #terminalLastCommand\"](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-explain.png)  \\n#### Preview: Terminal Inline Chat  \\nA preview of the terminal Inline Chat is available in this release, which gives convenient access to Copilot\\'s capabilities directly in the terminal.  \\nYou can enable terminal Inline Chat with the <code codesetting=\"terminal.integrated.experimentalInlineChat:true\">terminal.integrated.experimentalInlineChat</code> setting. To invoke the inline chat in a terminal, use the `kb(inlinechat.start)` keybinding.  \\n![Opening terminal inline chat will open and focus an input box similar to inline chat in the editor](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-inline.png)  \\nThe terminal Inline Chat uses the `@terminal` chat participant, which has context about the integrated terminal\\'s shell and its contents.  \\n![You can ask complex questions like \"list the top 5 largest files in the src directory\"](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-inline-query.png)  \\nOnce a command is suggested, use `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.runCommand)` to run the command in the terminal or `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.insertCommand)` to insert the command into the terminal. The command can also be edited directly in Copilot\\'s response before running it (currently `kbstyle(Ctrl+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on Windows & Linux, `kbstyle(Cmd+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on macOS).  \\n![Complex queries are OS and shell-specific](images/1_88/copilot-terminal-inline-answer.png)  \\n#### Clarity on authentication flow  \\nClarity around authentication is very important. We want to be clear about how we authenticate and what we ask for. If you open a private repository in VS Code, and we don\\'t have the right authentication for this scenario, we present an authentication dialog. The dialog has a description of why authentication is needed, and a **Learn more** button to find out more about these requirements.  \\n![Screenshot of a modal window that\\'s asking to authenticate with GitHub and that contains a Learn more button](images/1_88/learnmoreauth.png)  \\nThe **Learn more** button takes you to our [documentation on authentication requirements](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/blob/a032cf75104a99ca745118ca51ea77219441a898/docs/copilot-repo-scope.md).  \\n#### Variable references  \\nThe **Used references** section in a chat response gives information about the context that is used. Previously, this section only showed context that was pulled in implicitly. Now, it also shows variables that you mentioned explicitly in the chat prompt, such as `#file` or `#editor`. If a variable is missing from the Used references, it might indicate that it was ignored because it\\'s too large for the context window of the language model.  \\n![Screenshot of a chat response, showing the \\'#file\\' variable in the Used references section](images/1_88/chat-variable-reference.png)  \\n#### Secondary chat submit actions  \\nIn the Chat view, the chat submit button now has a dropdown for easy access to more actions.  \\n* **Send to @workspace** submits your query to the `@workspace` chat participant, which is useful for questions about the contents of your workspace\\n* **Send to New Chat** starts a new empty chat, and then submits the query  \\n![Screenshot of the chat submit dropdown options](images/1_88/chat-submit-dropdown.png)  \\n#### Scope selection when using `Copilot: Explain This`  \\nWhen you use `/explain` without a selection in your active editor, and there are multiple scopes of interest, we\\'ve added support for prompting to clarify which symbol or block scope to explain.  \\n![Screenshot of the scope selection quick pick when the scope for /explain is unclear](images/1_88/copilot-scope-selection.png)  \\nThis behavior is currently opt-in, behind the <code codesetting=\"github.copilot.chat.scopeSelection\">github.copilot.chat.scopeSelection</code> setting.',\n",

       " {'content': 'Learn what is new in the Visual Studio Code May 2024 Release (1.90)  \\n## Contributions to extensions  \\n### GitHub Copilot  \\n#### Attach context to chat  \\nTo make your chat prompts more specific, you can add context to your chat messages. You can now attach more types of context to a chat message, such as workspace symbols. Previously, you used the \\'#\\' symbol to reference a file, or the current selection. Now, you can attach context  to a chat message by selecting the 📎 icon in the Chat view input field, or by typing `kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)`.  \\n> **Tip**: Use the right arrow key to quickly attach context in the background while you keep the context picker open. When you\\'re in the editor, you can also right-click on a selection and choose **Copilot > Add Selection to Chat**.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_90/chat-context-attachments.mp4\" title=\"Attach context to chat\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>  \\n#### Ask questions using Bing search and enterprise knowledge bases  \\n[GitHub Copilot Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/overview/about-github-copilot-enterprise) users in VS Code can now ask questions that are enriched with context from web results and your enterprise\\'s [knowledge bases](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/copilot-chat-in-github/managing-copilot-knowledge-bases). To try out this functionality, install the latest pre-release of Copilot Chat.  \\nIn the Chat view, you can ask questions like `@github What is the latest LTS of Node.js? #web` to take advantage of web search. Any search results referenced by Copilot are displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.  \\n![Web search results in Copilot Chat](images/1_90/copilot-enterprise-bing-search.png)  \\nYou can also ask questions about your enterprise\\'s knowledge bases, which are collections of Markdown repositories containing documentation, directly from VS Code. Simply type `@github #kb` to pick from the knowledge bases available to you. Similarly, any knowledge base snippets referenced by Copilot are displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.  \\nThis enables Copilot Enterprise users to combine search results and internal documentation with editor context by using existing chat variables, such as `#file` and `#selection`. Please try it out and share your feedback with us at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release!  \\n#### IntelliSense in chat code blocks  \\nWe now support basic IntelliSense within Copilot-generated code blocks. This lets you use many of the same IntelliSense tools that you might already use in the editor and can help you better understand the generated code.  \\n![Hover IntelliSense in Copilot chat code block](images/1_90/copilot-hover-intellisense.png)  \\nThe supported IntelliSense features include:  \\n- Go to definition by using `kbstyle(ctrl)` `kbstyle(click)` / `kbstyle(cmd)` `kbstyle(click)` or `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)`\\n- Hovers\\n- Go to implementation\\n- Go to type definition  \\nIntelliSense can even be used with `@workspace` to learn about any workspace symbols that are used in Copilot responses.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_90/copilot-workspace-intellisense.mp4\" title=\"IntelliSense on a @workspace code block\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>  \\nIntelliSense for TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code blocks is available out of the box. For additional language support, try installing an extension for that language, although not every language extension already has support for code block IntelliSense. Please file feature requests for any languages that aren\\'t yet supporting this.  \\n#### Improved links in chat responses  \\nWe improved chat responses by adding links for file names and symbols. By selecting these links, you can navigate to the corresponding file or symbol in the editor.  \\n![Clickable links for symbols used with /explain](images/1_90/copilot-link-explain.png)  \\n![Clickable file and symbol links for an @workspace question](images/1_90/copilot-link-workspace.png)  \\n#### Roam active chat between inline chat and Chat view  \\nYou can now move a chat request that is completed or still active from inline chat to the Chat view. You might use this feature to clean up inline chat and move conversations to a more persistent place. To move a request, select the chat icon next to the chat input box.  \\n![Move a chat conversation from inline chat to the Chat view](images/1_90/move-chat-conversation-to-chat-view.png)  \\n#### Automatic rename suggestions  \\nIf you use the [Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension, the Copilot-powered rename suggestions are now triggered automatically when you rename a symbol. You can turn this feature off by using the setting <code codesetting=\"github.copilot.renameSuggestions.triggerAutomatically\">github.copilot.renameSuggestions.triggerAutomatically</code>.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_90/rename-suggestions.mp4\" title=\"Automatically-triggered rename suggestions\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>',\n",
